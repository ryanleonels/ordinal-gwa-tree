### Light 0.5 • 2023/05/21
Light Mode and Anticharge. Also fixed a few bugs.

### 0.4.4 • 2023/05/17
- Capped aleph 1's effect exponent

- fixed cardinal distribution if you have >1k cardinals

### Cardinal Upgrades part 2 0.4.3 • 2023/05/16
Fixed ordinal display bug, changed sm40 to sm41, and added some new effects to sm41 and sm55

### Cups 0.4.2 • 2023/05/16
Added 3 more milestones and 8 upgrades. Also buffed some of the weaker alephs. (only 7 of the upgrades are actually implemented though)

### The bug fix update v0.4.1 • 2023/05/15
- dynamic cap is now shown
- fixed some other bugs
- buffed aleph 1
- added a free 2x incrementy multiplier after first collapse from aleph 4
- BHO is now voidgwa in gwaified mode
- added a save importer for mobile for saves longer than 5k chars

### Collapse 0.4 • 2023/05/15
- it's collapsing time
- Cardinals and sluggish milestones now exist, although I don't know how far you can get yet

Endgame: ??? (unknown) (I think it's probably around 10 of each cardinal, although I've only done 1 collapse so idk)

### Overflow Part 3 0.3.5 • 2023/05/13
Added more charge. Collapse coming soon™️!

Endgame: 1e100 incrementy, 89 factor boosts, and 7 base shifts. You could go past this, but collapse is going to reset almost everything next update

### Overflow part 2 0.3.4 • 2023/05/12
- Charge is now implemented, although it's different from ordinal pringles for balance reasons
- The first 2 rows of booster upgrades can be charged. Last 2 rows will be there next update

Endgame: 9 charge and 75 factor boosts, do not go past this because it may be unbalanced. I recommend turning offline progress off.

### Overflow part 1 0.3.3 • 2023/05/11
- New tab, the overflow tab! Once you reach 40 factor boosts you'll start generating booster power with excess boosters, which boost previous mechanics!
- This is part 1 of the overflow update, charges will be coming out next update!
Endgame: 50 factor boosts

### 0.3.2 • 2023/05/10
Fixed that weird export bug. Also fixed the ordinal length bug.

### 0.3.1 • 2023/05/09
Added qol and patched a potential exploit
